                    My name's Pranava Mr. I am 12 and a half years old. I have little brother Aadya who is 5 years old. He is the best thing that happened in my life. 
                    I study in NPS International,<br> a school where education is not the only priority but enjoying is. I live with my parents , brother and grandmother.
                    I am mostly attracted towards music and I am glad to<br> know that as enjoying music is a unique ability. I like to draw a lot as it helps me to express
                    my inexpressible feelings . Coding has always been a sidekick for me. Other<br> than this exploring and playing sports has always soothened my mind.
                    I am a fair storywriter and a grammar freak(if there are options for answers).<br> To be honest I like video games too. I know various languages such 
                    as Java, HTML, SQL, PHP, Dart & JS.
